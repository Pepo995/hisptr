# Create T3 App

This is a [T3 Stack](https://create.t3.gg/) project bootstrapped with `create-t3-app`.

## What's next? How do I make an app with this?

We try to keep this project as simple as possible, so you can start with just the scaffolding we set up for you, and add additional things later when they become necessary.

If you are not familiar with the different technologies used in this project, please refer to the respective docs. If you still are in the wind, please join our [Discord](https://t3.gg/discord) and ask for help.

## Eslint, Prettier and Husky.

We have eslint, prettier and husky configured to make our work easy.
To access and edit that configuration you can use the following files/folders:

- `.prettierrc`
- `commitlint.config.js`
- `.husky/**`
- `.eslintrc.cjs`: Here we define the rules to be applied when the linter is running.
- `.eslintignore`: Here we define the files/patterns to be ignored from the eslint. Since we're working on a project that was already started when we added the rules, we ignore a lot of files but we should remove those ignores step by step when we adapt those files to our new rules.
